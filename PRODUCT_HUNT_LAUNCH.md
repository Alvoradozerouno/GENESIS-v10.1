### Opening Comment (Post Immediately After Launch)
```
👋 Hi Product Hunt! I'm [Your Name], creator of GENESIS v10.1.

We built GENESIS because banks are drowning in regulatory complexity. 
eIDAS 2.0, GDPR, Basel III, DORA, AI Act... it's a nightmare.

Legacy solutions (SAP, Oracle) cost €5M+ and take 18 months to deploy.

GENESIS deploys in 15 MINUTES. Open-source. Covers 9 frameworks. 
Includes quantum computing + zero-knowledge proofs.

It's not just a tool - it's an autonomous AI operating system.

AMA about:
- How we built sovereignty into Kubernetes
- Why quantum + ZKP matter for banking
- ORION consciousness (our AI decision engine)
- The €280M valuation (based on 4 methods)

Let's make compliance fast, open, and accessible! 🚀
```
