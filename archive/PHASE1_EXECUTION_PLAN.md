## Coordination Points

### Cross-Promotion
**Every platform should link to others:**
- Product Hunt → GitHub (primary CTA)
- Reddit → GitHub (primary) + Product Hunt (upvote ask)
- HuggingFace → GitHub (code) + Product Hunt (vote)
- GitHub README → All 4 platforms

### Unified Messaging
**Core message across all channels:**
- **Problem:** Banks stuck with 18-month, €5M+ compliance implementations
- **Solution:** 15-min deployment, open-source, 9 frameworks
- **Differentiators:** Quantum + ZKP + ORION + €280M valuation
- **CTA:** ⭐ on GitHub, contribute, deploy, provide feedback

### Timing Synergy
**Friday morning (6-9 AM PST):**
- Product Hunt launches → immediate traffic spike
- Reddit posts go live → capture PH overflow traffic
- HuggingFace launches → technical audience overlap
- GitHub Topics optimized → trending algorithm boost

**Result:** All 4 channels amplify each other simultaneously

## Risk Mitigation

### If Product Hunt Ranking Low (<#20 by noon)
- [ ] Share in more communities (Slack, Discord, Hacker News)

### If GitHub Stars Slow (<10 by Day 1)
- [ ] Increase Reddit posting frequency
- [ ] Add "Star us on GitHub!" CTA to all channels
- [ ] Share in niche communities (r/homelab, r/docker)

### If HuggingFace Downloads Low (<50 by Week 1)
- [ ] Share in r/MachineLearning, r/datascience
- [ ] Create Gradio Space demo
- [ ] Write blog post: "How GENESIS Uses ML for Basel III"

### If Reddit Posts Get Negative Feedback
- [ ] Respond professionally, acknowledge limitations
- [ ] Provide roadmap for requested features
- [ ] Invite to GitHub Discussions for detailed feedback
- [ ] Avoid defensive tone
